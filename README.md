# Homework Assignment #14

In this homework assignment, we continue refining our REST API application from the previous tasks (Homework #13).

## Tasks

### 1. Sphinx Documentation

Utilize Sphinx to create comprehensive documentation for your application. Add docstrings to the necessary functions and methods within the main modules. Document the following:

- Module descriptions
- Class descriptions (if applicable)
- Function/method descriptions
- Parameter explanations
- Return value descriptions
- Usage examples (if needed)

### 2. Unit Testing with Unittest

Cover the repository modules with unit tests using the Unittest framework. Model your test files after the example in the course notes (`tests/test_unit_repository_notes.py`). Ensure that your tests cover various scenarios and edge cases.

### 3. Functional Testing with Pytest

Cover at least one API route of your choice with functional tests using the Pytest framework. Write tests to verify the correct behavior of the selected route. Include tests for different input scenarios and edge cases.

## Additional Task

### Achieve Test Coverage of Over 95%

Strive for extensive test coverage in your application by using the `pytest-cov` package. Monitor the coverage percentage and ensure it surpasses 95%. This ensures a high level of confidence in the reliability and correctness of your code.

These tasks aim to enhance the quality and maintainability of your REST API application by providing clear documentation and robust test coverage. The combination of Sphinx documentation, unit tests, and functional tests contributes to a well-documented and thoroughly tested codebase. Achieving over 95% test coverage ensures that your application is rigorously tested across various scenarios.
